Chaos Mesh is an open source cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform. It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios. ... To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides you with a perfect visualization operation.

Chaos Mesh is a versatile chaos engineering solution that features all-around fault injection methods for complex systems on Kubernetes, covering faults in Pod, network, file system, and even the kernel.



Choas Mesh is one of the better chaos engines for Kubernetes because:

- In a short amount of time there has been heavy community support and it's a CNCF sandbox project.
- It's a native experience to Kubernetes leveraging the Operator Pattern and CRDs permitting IaC with your pipelines.
- If you have followed the best practices by applying plenty of labels and annotations to your Deployments, then there is no need to make modifications to your apps for your chaos experiments.
- There are a wide variety of experiment types, not just Pod killing.
- Installs with a Helm chart and you have complete control over the engine with CRDs.

## In this scenario you will learn how to:

- Install chaos-mesh using helm(helm is a package manager for kubernetes) on kubernetes.

- Uninstall chaos-mesh using helm.
